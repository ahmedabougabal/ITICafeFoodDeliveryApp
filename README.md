# ITI Café Order System

## Core Architecture & Administrative Capabilities

Our project, a sophisticated and scalable **Café Order System**, is a true testament to the power of teamwork and modern web development. Built by a **dedicated team of 5 ITI developers**, this solution has been endorsed by **ITI's open source leaders, Eng. Cherry and Eng. Mina Nagy**, recognizing its potential for freelancing and real-world applications.

The **admin panel** is the cornerstone of this system, providing a **robust**, **elegant**, and **crispy** interface that ensures seamless management. This project was executed through **intensive meeting plans**, **late-night coding sessions**, and adherence to **Agile working methodologies**, supported by **JIRA** for task management, tracking, and deadline compliance.

### Sales Statistics Functionality
One of the system's standout features is its **Sales Statistics** functionality, powered by **Python-written MySQL queries** that dynamically feed the backend data into the front-end to generate actionable insights. Key metrics visualized through our **interactive design** include:
- **Daily sales totals** in real-time
- **Rolling 7-day performance analytics**
- **30-day comprehensive reports**
- **Top customer rankings** and their purchases
- **Most popular item analytics**

This functionality is presented through a polished, **sophisticated interface**, underscoring the professional finesse and attention to detail that went into the project. Every chart and metric is crafted to display vital business insights effortlessly.

## Revolutionary Order Management Workflow

The **order management system** is another hallmark of our project, built to optimize efficiency and deliver an intuitive, **breathtaking user experience**. The process operates in three seamless phases:

### 1. Pending Orders Phase
When a customer places an order through the visually stunning **client-side interface**, it lands in the **Pending Orders** section of the **admin panel**. Chiefs can:
- **Accept** or **reject** orders, with every action triggering an immediate, automated notification:
  - **Email alerts** sent directly to the customer
  - **Real-time updates** in the user’s **notification center**

### 2. Active Preparation Phase
Once accepted, orders enter the **Active Preparation Phase**, where our system incorporates:
- **Real-time tracking** of the order's preparation
- **Crisp visual countdown timers** in both the customer and admin interfaces
- **Red-flag alerts** for orders exceeding preparation times
- **Interactive progress bars** that display the order's status to the customer in real-time

### 3. Completion Phase
In the **Completion Phase**, the order lifecycle is finalized with:
- **Payment verification** for cash transactions, handled by the admin
- **Automated status updates** reflected in the user’s **order history**
- **Real-time synchronization** of payment statuses to ensure clarity and ease for both the user and the admin.

Additionally, we utilized **Git** and **GitHub** extensively for version control, navigating **intensive conflict resolution sessions** to ensure collaboration without disruption.

### Multi-Branch Architecture
The system supports a **multi-branch structure**, allowing users to switch between **ITI branches** based on location without needing to log out. Each branch offers a unique menu and is managed independently, ensuring a customized user experience.

### Real-Time Communication Hub
Our **real-time communication hub** is built on a powerful **WebSocket integration**, enabling:
- **Instant chat functionality** between customers and staff

- **Real-time payment status updates** visible to both customers and admins

### Mobile-First Design
The entire platform follows **mobile-first design principles**, ensuring:
- A **responsive, elegant experience** on mobile devices
- Seamless functionality across all device types, with an **optimized touch interface**

### Polling System Architecture
Our system also employs a sophisticated **polling architecture**, ensuring:
