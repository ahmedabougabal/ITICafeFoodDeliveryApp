# 🍽 ITI Cafe Food Delivery/Ordering App - ITI Graduation Project

Hey Folks! 👋

It's bittersweet to announce that this is our **final ITI graduation project**, but we are excited to share what we've built! 🎓✨ We wanted to leave a lasting impression and solve a real-life problem we encountered within our beloved institution, refer to the repo's description :D

## 🚀 Project Overview

The core idea of our project is to **simplify the process of ordering food during session breaks**. 🥪 Whether you're a student, instructor, or external guest, the goal is to **reduce waiting times**, avoid **queue jams**, and make the whole experience more seamless. Our web app enables users to order food online from the ITI Cafe, saving time for both students and instructors for more demanding tasks/Breaks in-between sessions.

### 💡 Key Features:
- **Order Anytime, Anywhere**: Place food orders online to avoid long queues.
- **Save your Precious Rest moments**: Never waste your time in queues again.
- **Literally for Everyone**: Built for students, instructors, and even external visitors who may not be familiar with the ITI.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
We have chosen a **robust and scalable tech stack** to ensure our app runs smoothly and efficiently:

- **Backend**: [Python](https://www.python.org/) / [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- **Database**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **Package Management**: [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
- **Deployment**: Coming soon!
